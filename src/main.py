# The types of questions covered beside the old type of question are:
# When, Where, Which. Moreover, the most important thing is that all
# these new type of questions are based on the fact that the property
# is expressed by the main verb of the sentence and in particular this
# system cover the verbs that are inside the variable
# property_translator. NOTE: it is therefore trivial to add new verbs
# to this variable, therefore the system can be easily enhanced.
